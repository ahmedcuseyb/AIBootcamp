7-Day Machine Learning Training Program

 Overview
 
This repository documents a 7-day Machine Learning training program structured into 5 days of guided learning and 2 days of hands-on practical implementation.
The program is designed to take learners from foundational concepts to real-world machine learning model deployment, with strong emphasis on practice and real applications.

By the end of this training, participants gain a solid understanding of:

Data preprocessing

Feature engineering

Machine learning algorithms

Model evaluation

User interfaces

Model deployment


🎯 Training Objectives

Build strong foundations in Machine Learning
Understand supervised and unsupervised learning
Apply feature engineering techniques
Deploy trained models for real-world usage
Connect ML models to user interfaces
