7-Day Machine Learning Training Program

 Overview
This repository documents a 7-day intensive Machine Learning training program designed to take learners from foundational concepts to real-world model deployment.
The program emphasizes hands-on practice, clear explanations, and practical deployment using modern tools.
By the end of this training, participants gain a solid understanding of:
Data preprocessing
Feature engineering
Machine learning algorithms
Model evaluation
User interfaces
Model deployment
